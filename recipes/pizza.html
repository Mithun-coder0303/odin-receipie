    <p>How Long Does Pizza Dough Last In the Fridge?
This pizza dough will last for about five days in the fridge. Store it in an airtight storage container or a bowl tightly covered with storage wrap. Allow the refrigerated dough to sit for about 30 minutes at room temperature before using.</p>

<p><strong> You Freeze Pizza Dough?</strong>
Yes! You can absolutely freeze pizza dough. This is a great option for people who make pizza often. Prepare the dough for freezing by rolling it into a ball and lightly coating it with oil. Place the ball in a freezer-safe container labeled with the date. Freeze for about three months.</p>

To thaw the dough, simply transfer it to the fridge the night before you plan to use it.
